# JavaScript Algorithm Exercises

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript exercises focusing on algorithms and data structures, particularly binary search applications. The exercises include finding specific elements within sorted arrays, counting occurrences, and handling rotated arrays.

## Exercises Included

- `countZeroes.js`: Count the number of zeros in a sorted array of 1s followed by 0s.
- `findFloor.js`: Find the floor of a given number in a sorted array.
- `findRotatedIndex.js`: Find the index of a given number in a rotated sorted array.
- `findRotationCount.js`: Determine how many times a sorted array has been rotated.
- `sortedFrequency.js`: Count the occurrences of a number in a sorted array.

Each exercise is accompanied by Jest tests to validate the implementation.
